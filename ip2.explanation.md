This is an explanation of the rationale behind Docker Compose configuration in setting up a multi-container application with a client, backend, and MongoDB service, each running in its own container. The configuration uses Docker networks to isolate communication between different parts of the application, ensuring that only necessary services can communicate with each other. Docker volumes are used to persist data, and ports are exposed to allow access from the host machine. This setup ensures a resilient and maintainable environment for deploying and running the YOLO application.
